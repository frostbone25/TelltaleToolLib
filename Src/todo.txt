TODO LIST:

- STYLE GUIDES
- DECOMPRESSION AND COMPRESSION ON META STREAMS (ATTACH AND CLOSE) (DO THIS WITH EPAGE AND ESTORE, LAST)
- DIALOG
- ANM
- CHORE
- PROP PARENT SEARCHING. MAKE API FOR FINDING OTHERS FROM ARCHIVES, ABSTRACT IT ETC (EDIT STYLE GUIDE AFTER TO SEARCH PARENTS IN ACTINGOVERRIDABLEPROPOWNER AND OTHERS)

notes:
metastream deletes the datastream passed on open
can only write MSV6, implement more in future (maybe check EXEs)
TTCZ/TTCE are datastreamcontainers (see DataStreamContainerParams):
mpDstStream     Ptr<DataStream>
mpSrcStream     Ptr<DataStream> //telltale ptr type, just a normal ptr will do 
mDstOffset      dq
mWindowSize     dd
mbCompress      db
mbEncrypt       db
mCompressionLibrary dd ? ; enum Compression::Library
//db byte dd int32 dq int64 (quad)

THINGS THAT DONT WORK WITH THE LIB
- VERSION CRCS! HOW THE FUCK? DO? YOU? CALCULATE THEM?! NOTE if i get them to work, scene agent info wont work since i skipped the mpAgent member
