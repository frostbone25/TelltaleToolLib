TODO LIST:

- D3DMESH - below michonne
- META VERSIONING - GO THROUGH ALL TYPES AND ADD MEMBER DESC VERSIONS

- PROP PARENT SEARCHING. ITS NOT IMPLEMENTED! PROBABALY WONT BE
- .BUNDLE .PROBE ARE NOT SUPPORTED
notes:
when making telltale ui editor, remember batfix for d3dmesh, get members using
wd4 set key then set back
metastream deletes the datastream passed on open
can only write MSV6&5, implement more in future (maybe check EXEs)
TTCZ/TTCE are datastreamcontainers (see DataStreamContainerParams):
mpDstStream     Ptr<DataStream>
mpSrcStream     Ptr<DataStream> //telltale ptr type, just a normal ptr will do 
mDstOffset      dq
mWindowSize     dd
mbCompress      db
mbEncrypt       db
mCompressionLibrary dd ? ; enum Compression::Library
//db byte dd int32 dq int64 (quad)

THINGS THAT DONT WORK WITH THE LIB
- VERSION CRCS! HOW THE FUCK? DO? YOU? CALCULATE THEM?! NOTE if i get them to work, scene agent info wont work since i skipped the mpAgent member
